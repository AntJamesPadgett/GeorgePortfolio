This is my first front-end website I have ever Built. I built from scratch ( following ) a tutorial.. I know thats an oxymoron.. BUT I learned alot, its an omage to one of my favorite sitcoms from the 90s, being a NewYorker.. Seinfeld holds a special place in my heart. I used Html, Css and a touch of JavaScript.. I will be doing a few more to really refine my skills..
